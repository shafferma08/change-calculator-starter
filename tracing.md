To trace an error using the debugging tools, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Developer Tools in your browser: Most browsers have built-in developer tools that include a JavaScript debugger. You can usually access the developer tools by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on macOS).

2. Locate the JavaScript file: In the developer tools, navigate to the "Sources" or "Debugger" tab and find the JavaScript file you want to debug. In this case, locate the JavaScript file with the code you provided.

3. Set a breakpoint: Click on the line number corresponding to the line where you suspect the error occurs. This sets a breakpoint, and the debugger will pause the execution of the code at that line.

4. Trigger the error: Perform the actions that would cause the error to occur. In this case, you need to trigger the `calcChange` function. This can be done by triggering the event listeners attached to the `cashBox` and `billBox` elements. For example, you can change the values in those input fields.

5. Debug the code: Once the breakpoint is hit, the debugger will pause the execution of the code at that line. You can now inspect the current state of variables and step through the code line by line to identify the source of the error.

6. Step through the code: You can use the debugger's controls to step through the code. The typical controls include "step into" (goes inside a function call), "step over" (executes the current line and moves to the next line), and "step out" (exits the current function and moves to the calling function). Use these controls to move through the `calcChange` function and observe the values of variables at each step.

7. Check variable values: At each step, inspect the values of variables such as `changeValue`, `bill20Amt`, `bill10Amt`, etc., to see if they hold the expected values. Verify if the calculations and assignments are correct. If the values are incorrect, you can identify where the issue lies.

8. Continue debugging: If necessary, continue stepping through the code until you find the specific line or lines causing the incorrect breakdown of units of currency.

By following these steps and carefully observing the values of variables during debugging, you should be able to identify the source of the error in the code.
